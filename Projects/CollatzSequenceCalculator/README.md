# RockPaperScissors
This script will compute the Collatz Sequence based on  
a starting integer of your choosing. It will then tell  
you how many interations of the Collatz operation it took  
to reach the end of the sequence. 

It will also validate that the user entered a valid integer,  
and prompt the user to re-enter their value to continue.
