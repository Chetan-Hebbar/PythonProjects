# CoinFlip Streaks
This program simulates an arbitrary number of iterations of an 
arbitrary number of coin flips, and then tells you the percentage
of those iterations which have a streak of X consecutive heads or
tails.

For instance, you can specify that you want to flip a coin 100 times,
measuring whether or not a streak of six or more heads/tails appears. You
then want to understand, over 1000 such experiments, how many sets of flips
yielded a streak.

###An example output:  
*Enter number of flips per iteration*  
**100**  
*Enter length of streak to test*  
**6**  
*Enter number of iterations to sample*  
**10000**

*Chance of streak: 80.02%*
